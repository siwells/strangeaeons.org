The [slash project](https://slashpages.net/) is an attempt to build a set of commonly named and understood pages that sites can choose to implement, or not. As I already had an [about page](/about/) I've decided to include some of the other slash pages on this site.

One of the interesting aspects of slash pages is the idea that site have certain kinds of information at certain, commonly named, locations. Whilst this is perhaps not Semantic Web levels of automatically processable information, it should make it a little easier to discover authentic personal human websites amongst all of the corporate and AI slop. It feels like there is an opportunity in these somewhere for a specialised search engine of some sort...
