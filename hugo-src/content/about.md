Just a small place on the web for some of my writing, thoughts, and ideas, that don't otherwise fit into all of the other venues available to me. This time I think it is worth starting with a blank slate so I've archived past posts. Partly because re-reading the juvenalia of older writing is a mistake when you're revamping a site, but also because my interests have changed over the years and I want to concentrate on all new essay about my current interests.

Strange Aeons isn't really a blog. Whilst the default ordering of posts is reverse chronological, in the style of a blog, I reserve the right to return to earlier posts, edit them to match my current thinking, and allow them to float to the top again. So rather than being strictly an ordering of posts, the order is really an accounting of things I've edited most recently. Similarly, the pages and posts are interchangeable to some degree, the posts covering lots of varied ground, whilst pages are aimed at being more focussed. The majority of pages are [slashes](/slashes/) and are not linked exhaustively into the menu column, but I plan to also use some pages to provide organising indexes to various topics that I return to frequently. Probably many of these topic indexes will relateto things I list in my [interests](/interests/). Ultimately, one way to consider this site is as a digital garden.


### History

This is probably, as far as I can recall, perhaps the fourth or fifth iteration of "Strange Aeons", having been variously hosted on servers available to me at the university of Dundee, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh Napier. It's gone through various software support incarnations as well. Starting off as a WordPress blog, moving to hand-coded HTML for a while, and now, making the most of Hugo for that balance of static performance and scripted/automated/managed goodness.
