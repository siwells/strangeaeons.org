      <description>Like many of my teaching related posts, this has been spurred by interactions with students over the last couple of years. This post is specifically meant to answer the question of &amp;ldquo;what does an academic do with their time?&amp;rdquo; given that, at least for some students, there is very little idea of what goes on at a university, outside of timetabled classes.&#xA;First a caveat. This post won&amp;rsquo;t be applicable to every member of academic staff at every university, and definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply outside of the UK, and Scotland specifically.</description>
