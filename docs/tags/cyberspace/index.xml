      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently returned to IRC after a multi-year hiatus. Twenty years ago I hung out there a fair amount, then as life took its various twists and turns, I used it less and less frequently, until I&amp;rsquo;d not logged in for a good decade or so. My last serious usage was when I was involved in running the Tayside Linux User Group (TLUG) back in the mid-noughties and early teens. Not to be confused with the Tokyo Linux Users Group who are also referred to as TLUG (or the Thuringer one for that matter).</description>
