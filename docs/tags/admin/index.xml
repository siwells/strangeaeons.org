      <description>This site has no facility for direct comments because I feel that easy, consequence-free, ill-considered, commentary and discussion has coarsened public discussion.&#xA;I think an element of the problem is a mixture of immediacy and anonymity, combined with a pathological tendency in many people towards reactionary anger. If people can react quickly, and in the moment, especially without consequence, then I think people are more likely to, in the best case, use perhaps ill-considered wording, and in the worst case, to fully indulge their worst inclinations.</description>
