      <description>A recent conversation with a student led me to reflect on my approach to research and writing. These notes might prove useful to someone, somewhere, perhaps, as an example of one research flow. I daresay others have their own working methods, but this is one I&amp;rsquo;ve refined over a long period into something that works consistently for me.&#xA;Nearly all of my work involves either thinking and writing. As an academic, these two practices, thinking and reading, revolve around both my own ideas and the published ideas of others.</description>
